# reflections

These are answers/reflections to questions being asked by Udacity instructors.
I'm working thru the front-end developer curriculum.
Some pretty ridiculous answers!  Not sure if that's because the questions are vague and of
poor quality, or I'm just so clueless that I don't have any good answers?
